## üîê Admin Registration Note

Make sure you explicitly register the model with the Django admin. Either use:

```python
@admin.register(CommandExecution)
class CommandExecutionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ...
```

**or**, if you're not using decorators, you must add:

```python
admin.site.register(CommandExecution)
```
